## Auth

- <a name="route.config.auth"></a>`auth` - authentication configuration. Value can be:
        - `false` to disable authentication if a default strategy is set.
        - a string with the name of an authentication strategy registered with `server.auth.strategy()`.
        - an object with:
            - `mode` - the authentication mode. Defaults to `'required'` if a server authentication strategy is configured, otherwise defaults
              to no authentication. Available values:
                - `'required'` - authentication is required.
                - `'optional'` - authentication is optional (must be valid if present).
                - `'try'` - same as `'optional'` but allows for invalid authentication.
            - `strategies` - a string array of strategy names in order they should be attempted. If only one strategy is used, `strategy` can
              be used instead with the single string value. Defaults to the default authentication strategy which is available only when a single
              strategy is configured.
            - `payload` - if set, the payload (in requests other than 'GET' and 'HEAD') is authenticated after it is processed. Requires a strategy
              with payload authentication support (e.g. [Hawk](#hawk-authentication)). Available values:
                - `false` - no payload authentication. This is the default value.
                - `'required'` - payload authentication required.
                - `'optional'` - payload authentication performed only when the client includes payload authentication information (e.g.
                  `hash` attribute in Hawk).
            - `scope` - the application scope required to access the route. Value can be a scope string or an array of scope strings. The authenticated
              credentials object `scope` property must contain at least one of the scopes defined to access the route. Defaults to no scope required.
            - `entity` - the required authenticated entity type. If set, must match the `entity` value of the authentication credentials. Available
              values:
                - `any` - the authentication can be on behalf of a user or application. This is the default value.
                - `user` - the authentication must be on behalf of a user.
                - `app` - the authentication must be on behalf of an application.
